# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

This repository contains examples and exercises related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language from ALX problems. These concepts are fundamental to programming in C, and understanding how they work is essential for anyone looking to develop low-level systems software or optimize performance-critical code.

### 0. 98 Battery st. 
[reset_to_98](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c)<br>
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. 

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream 
[swap_int](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)<br>
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers. 

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
[_strlen](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)<br>
Write a function that returns the length of a string. <br>
 - To use the `strlen` function, you should include the `string.h` library at the beginning of your code 

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them 
[_puts](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)<br>
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.<br>
 - To use the `puts` function, you should include the `stdio.h` library at the beginning of your code 

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear 
[print_rev](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)<br>
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes 
[rev_string](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c)<br>
Write a function that reverses a string.
