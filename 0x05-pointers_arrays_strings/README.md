# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

This repository contains examples and exercises related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language from ALX problems. These concepts are fundamental to programming in C, and understanding how they work is essential for anyone looking to develop low-level systems software or optimize performance-critical code.

### 0. 98 Battery st. 
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98 : [reset_to_98](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c)

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream 
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers : [swap_int](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
Write a function that returns the length of a string : [_strlen](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)
 - To use the `strlen` function, you should include the `string.h` library at the beginning of your code 

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them 
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout : [_puts](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)<br>
 - To use the `puts` function, you should include the `stdio.h` library at the beginning of your code 

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear 
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line : [print_rev](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes 
Write a function that reverses a string : [rev_string](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) <br> <br>
The reason for iterating only over the first half of the string (up to len/2) is that after that point, all the characters in the string will have been swapped.<br>

When reversing a string, you need to swap the first character with the last character, the second character with the second-to-last character, and so on, until you reach the middle of the string.<br>

If you continue the loop beyond the middle of the string, you would just be swapping the characters back to their original positions, undoing the work that you did earlier in the loop.

###  6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true 
Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line : [puts2](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6.puts2.c)

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half 
Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line : [puts_half](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7.puts_half.c)

	- The function should print the second half of the string
	- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

### 8. Arrays are not pointers 
Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line : [print_array](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c)
	- where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
	- Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
	- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
	- You are allowed to use printf

### 9. strcpy 
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest : [_strcpy](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c)
	- Return value: the pointer to dest
