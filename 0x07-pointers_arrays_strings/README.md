# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

### 0- memset
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte: [*_memset](0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/0-memset.c)
	- The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
	- Returns a pointer to the memory area s

### 1- memcpy
Write a function that copies memory area: [*_memcpy](0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/1-memcpy.c)
	- The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
	- Returns a pointer to dest

### 2- strchr
Write a function that locates a character in a string: [*_strchr](0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strchr.c)
	- Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

### 3- strspn
Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring: [_strspn](0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strspn.c)
	- Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
